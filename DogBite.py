#Let's answer our questions!'

#TREND CHARTS
#1. Throughout the years has the dog bite declined? (Trend Line)

#1.i. During which season do dogs bite more? (Bar Chart)
season_mode = mydataset.loc[:,"Season"].mode()
print("In ", season_mode, " dogs bite more.")


#BAR/PIE GRAPHS - MODE
#2. Which is the most aggressive dog breed? (Bar Chart)

#   print('The most aggressive gender is Masculine')
#elif gender_mode == 'F':

#else:
#   print('The most aggressive is unknown')

#2.ii. Which is the age at which dogs are more aggressive? (Bar Chart)

#2.iii. Do dogs with mixed breeds tend to bite more? (Pie Chart)

#HYPOTHESIS TESTING
#3. Do neutered dogs bite less?
#Ho = probability of neutered dog to bite = probability of non neutered dog to bite
#Ha = probability of neutered dog to bite != probability of non neutered dog to bite

#4. Which city has the highest number of dog bite vs least number of dog bites? (Back up question)
city_bite = mydataset.groupby("Borough")["DateOfBite"].count().sort_values(ascending=False)
city_bite_max = mydataset.groupby("Borough")["DateOfBite"].count().max()
